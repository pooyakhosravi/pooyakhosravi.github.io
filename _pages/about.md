I am an MD/PhD candidate at the [University of California, Irvine](https://medschool.uci.edu/), currently in my fourth year of the [Computer Science PhD program](https://www.ics.uci.edu/) advised by [Professor Xiaohui Xie](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~xhx/). My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, medical imaging, and clinical translation, with the overarching goal of developing computational methods that enhance diagnostic precision and improve patient outcomes.

My current work focuses on **AI in ophthalmology**, where I develop deep learning and generative models for retinal imaging modalities such as OCT, OCTA, and fundus photography. Specifically, I investigate multimodal representation learning and cross-dimensional translation frameworks to integrate structural and functional imaging data for disease prediction and progression modeling. I am also interested in how AI can be used to interpret complex biomedical data and to build tools that enable other researchers and clinicians to conduct analyses and gain insights more effectively.

### Research Interests
- Deep learning and computer vision for ophthalmic imaging (OCT, OCTA, fundus)  
- Generative modeling and diffusion-based image translation  
- Multimodal and longitudinal representation learning  
- Medical foundation models and clinical reasoning systems  
- Translational AI, precision medicine, and research-enabling tools
